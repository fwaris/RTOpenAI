### Library to call swipl Prolog via its C interface

**[Source Library](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/contrib-swiplcs)**

Modified substantially from source to run on dotnet core.

For now, have only tested limited functionality, on 64bit Windows.

Its, mainly used for testing of LLM generated Prolog code for RT.Assistant

Note a properly installed swipl environment should exist on the box where this is used.
